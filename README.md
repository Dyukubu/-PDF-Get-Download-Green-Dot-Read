Book Descriptions:
An irresistible and messy love story about the terrible allure of wanting something that promises nothing

At 24, Hera is a clump of unmet potential. To her, the future is nothing but an exhausting thought exercise, one depressing hypothetical after another. She‚Äôs sharp in more ways than one, adrift in her own smug malaise, until her new job moderating the comments section of an online news outlet‚Äîa role even more mind-numbing than it sounds‚Äîintroduces her to Arthur, a middle-aged journalist. Though she's preferred women to men for years now, she soon finds herself falling into an all-consuming affair with him. She is coming apart with want and loving every second of it! Well, except for the tiny hiccup of Arthur‚Äôs wife‚Äîand that said wife has no idea Hera exists.
